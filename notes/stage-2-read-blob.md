The `git hash-object` command is a plumbing command in Git that takes some data and stores it in the `.git/objects` directory, returning a unique key (usually a SHA-1 hash) that refers to the object.

### Example:

```bash
echo "hello world" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

- **`git hash-object`**: This command generates a SHA-1 hash (unique key) and creates a Git object.
- **`-w` flag**: This flag ensures the content is stored in the `.git/objects` directory as a blob object.
- **`--stdin`**: This option allows the command to take input from the standard input. In the example above, `hello world` is passed as input via the pipe.

### Examining the Content:

To inspect the content of the created object, you can use the `git cat-file` command:

```bash
git cat-file -p <blob-hash>
```

- **`git cat-file`**: This command is used to examine Git objects.
- **`-p` flag**: This flag is used to display the content of the object in a readable format.
